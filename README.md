# machine-learning-challenge

This is part of the machine learning challenge during my studies at Propulsion Academy Zürich.
The challenge was a kaggle data challenge to which 15 students participated.
All results can be found in this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/supervisedml2005

The challenge:
Complete the following:

Explore your data. Can you identify anything interest that is worth noting from the data?

Define a set of possible classifiers and show which one performs best. Keep in mind the problem of overfitting.

Using feature selection try to reduce the number of features. In the dataset you have over 120 features. Find the good ones for your classifier.
